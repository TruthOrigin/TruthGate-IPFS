## 🔧 What Is It?

TruthGate is a **secure edge layer for IPFS nodes**.  
Think **Netlify, but for IPFS** — self-hosted, login-protected, and actually yours.  

It solves the problems developers hit with IPFS:  
- Node exposure risks  
- SSL/domain linking headaches  
- CLI-only publishing  
- Zero protection for `/api` or `/webui` routes  
- Reliance on public gateways

## ❤️ A Note from the Creator

I built this out of frustration.  

I wanted a way to serve Web3-native apps that *actually worked* — securely, reliably, and without selling my soul to centralized hosts. Now it’s real.  

If you’ve ever wrestled with IPFS routing, SSL certs, or gateway hacks just to get your site online — **TruthGate is for you.**
